    <p>These are the steps to follow to add support for a new database to Flyway. </p><h4><a name="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites<a

    <ul>
        <li>Enhancement Issue created in Issue Tracker to explain your intent and centralize the discussion (make sure
            to mention the exact DBMS you which to support, which versions of the DBMS will be supported, if there is a
            free edition, where can it be downloaded)
        </li>
        <li>Dev Environment Setup</li>
        <li>Flyway building successfully locally</li>
        <li>Mercurial Clone Repository created on Google Code</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><a name="Code_Changes"></a>Code Changes<a href="#Code_Changes" class="section_anchor"></a></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Extend DbSupport</li>
        <li>Add new detection to DbSupportFactory</li>
        <li>Add new createMetaDataTable.sql</li>
        <li>Extend JdbcTemplate for DB-specific null support</li>
        <li>Extend SqlStatementBuilder for DB-specific parsing</li>
        <li>Extend MigrationTestCase and make sure all tests are green</li>
        <li>Extend ConcurrentMigrationTestCase and make sure test is green</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><a name="Finishing_Touches"></a>Finishing Touches<a href="#Finishing_Touches" class="section_anchor"></a></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure your Mercurial repo includes all the latest changes from mainline</li>
        <li>Push your changes to your mercurial repo</li>
        <li>Link to your repo from your issue</li>
        <li>Ask for feedback and rework as necessary</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once this is complete, and the quality meets our standards (in everyone&#x27;s best interest we can be very
        picky), it will then become a candidate for inclusion in the next release. </p>
