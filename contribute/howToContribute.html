    <p>This guide is primarily aimed at people wishing to contribute code to Flyway. If you want to report an issue
        instead have a look at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flyway/issues/list">Issue
            Tracker.</a><br/> <br/></p>

    <table class="wikitable">
        <tr>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px;"><strong>Tip:</strong> If your feature/bug fix doesn&#x27;t
                impact the DB-specific code and you do not wish to set up all the databases, Flyway can be built using
                <strong>mvn clean install -P-MediumTests</strong>. This will
                disable all tests against the DBs.
            </td>
        </tr>

    <h2><a name="Your_feature/patch/fix/extension"></a>Your feature/patch/fix/extension<a
            href="#Your_feature/patch/fix/extension" class="section_anchor"></a></h2>

    <p>Congratulations ! You now have a fully functional development environment for Flyway. You can now start
        contributing ! </p>

    <h3><a name="Raise_an_issue"></a>Raise an issue<a href="#Raise_an_issue" class="section_anchor"></a></h3>

    <p>The first step is to raise an issue in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flyway/issues/list">Issue
        Tracker</a>. This issue will be the place where you will be able to communicate with Flyway&#x27;s committers
        and other users. You can use it to present your ideas and gather feedback. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <h3><a name="Clone_the_repository"></a>Clone the repository<a href="#Clone_the_repository"
                                                                  class="section_anchor"></a></h3>

    <p>The next step is to create a server-side clone the default repository. Log in with your Google account and press
        the <i>Create Clone</i> button on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flyway/source/checkout">Source
            Tab</a>. Fill in the details and follow the instructions from there. </p>

    <p>If you have any problem with Google Code and Mercurial, don&#x27;t forget to have a look at the <a
            href="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/MercurialFAQ">Google Code Mercurial FAQ</a>. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <h3><a name="Write_awesome_code"></a>Write awesome code<a href="#Write_awesome_code" class="section_anchor"></a>
    </h3>

    <p>Now is the time to implement your stuff. Commit your changes to your clone and don&#x27;t forget to pull and
        merge the changes from the main repo as they happen. </p>

    <p>We use IntelliJ to develop Flyway. The <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/free_java_ide.html">free
        community edition</a> fits the bill perfectly. </p>

    <p>All source code is formatted using the default IntelliJ settings. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <h3><a name="Publish_your_changes"></a>Publish your changes<a href="#Publish_your_changes"
                                                                  class="section_anchor"></a></h3>

    <p>Satisfied with your work? Great! Now is the time to show the world! Post a link to your repo in the issue you
        created, and briefly describe your changes. We&#x27;ll have a look at them and if they&#x27;re fine we&#x27;ll
        merge them in the mainline and include them in the next release! </p>

    <p><br/> <strong>Happy coding !</strong><br/> <br/></p>
