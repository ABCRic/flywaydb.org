    <h3>Effective database migrations with Flyway</h3>

    <p>This “in-depth” intensive course equips your development team with advanced know-how of Flyway-based database
        migration - all through small, informative hands-on modules.</p>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>Join us for one day of intensive Flyway instruction. This class begins with a quick overview of what problems
        database migrations tools set out to solve. It then quickly moves into thorough coverage of everything from
        Flyway basics to topics like project integration, API and build tool integration, test data management and
        backward compatible migrations.</p>

    <p>You'll spend around half of your time actually hands-on with Flyway, and the other half talking with the instructor
        and learning directly from his live coding exercises. This class can take you from complete newcomer status to
        Flyway competence, or from passing familiarity to Flyway and database migrations expertise. Don't miss it.</p>
