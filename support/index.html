    <h2 id="sponsor">Sponsor a feature or bug fix</h2>

    <p>Need a feature or a bug fix? No problem. Cast your vote in the
        <a href="https://github.com/flyway/flyway/issues/">Issue Tracker.</a></p>

    <p>If it fits the vision of the project, we'll put it on the roadmap and implement it in one of the future
        releases.</p>

    <p>Do you need it faster and want to avoid the many costs and hassles of doing it yourself? We can help you.</p>

    <p><strong>You also have the option to sponsor the bug fix or feature.</strong></p>

    <p>This has many benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fast turnaround</strong>. We know the framework best, since we wrote it.</li>
        <li>Immediate access to pre-release binaries upon completion</li>
        <li>Formal invoice</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive price</strong> based on scope</li>
        <li>No digging in the framework internals</li>
        <li>No setting up the complex <a href="/contribute/code/setup.html">dev environment</a></li>
        <li>No implementation and debug effort</li>
        <li>No wait/risk of rejection for a merge into the main distribution</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And yes, this always includes free maintenance for all future releases.</p>

    <p>The price will cover developer time and will depend on the scope of the feature.</p>
