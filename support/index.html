    <p>If you're having trouble with Flyway, the Flyway developers and the Flyway community are here to help you!</p>

    <h3>Questions</h3>

    <p>If you have doubts or if you are stuck, you can ask a question under the <a class="stackoverflow-tag"
                                                                            href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flyway">flyway</a>
        tag on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flyway">StackOverflow</a>.</p>

    <h3>Features and Issues</h3>

    <p>If you think you've found an issue or if you would like to suggest a feature, you can do so in the <a
            href="http://code.google.com/p/flyway/issues/list">Issue
        Tracker</a>.</p>

    <p>We usually focus on fixing issues first, and then come new features.</p>

    <p>If there is a feature or a fix your organisation wants, and it hasn't been implemented yet, you also have the
        option to <a href="/support/payForFeature.html">pay a bounty</a> to have it implemented sooner.</p>

    <h3>Training</h3>

    <p>We also offer <a href="/support/training.html">professional training</a> to quickly get you up to speed and teach
        you all there is to know about <a href="/support/training.html">Effective Database Migrations with Flyway</a>.</p>
