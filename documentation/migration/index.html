    <h1>Migrations</h1>

    <p>Flyway updates the database from one version to the next using <strong>migrations</strong>.<br/> <br/>
        Each migration must have a <strong>unique version</strong> and optionally a description. </p>

    <p>Not all migrations are equally complex, therefore Flyway support both <a
            href="/documentation/migration/sql.html">Sql</a> and <a href="/documentation/migration/java.html">Java</a> migrations.
    </p>

    <p><a href="/documentation/migration/sql.html">Sql Migrations</a> are the most common and should fit the vast majority of
        the cases.<br/><br/> <a href="/documentation/migration/java.html">Java Migrations</a> are for advanced changes
        that are difficult or impossible to accomplish using Sql.<br/> This includes dealing with LOBs and advanced
        bulk data loads and transformations. </p>
