    <h1>API: hooks</h1>

    <p>There are three ways you can hook into the Flyway API.</p>

    <h2>Java-based Migrations</h2>

    <p>The first one is the the most common one: <a href="/documentation/migration/java.html">Java-based Migrations</a>
    when you need more power than SQL can offer you. This is great to for dealing with LOBs or performing advanced
    data transformations.</p>

    <p>This can be achieved by implementing the <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/migration/jdbc/JdbcMigration.html"
            >JdbcMigration</a></strong> interface.</p>

    <p>Alternatively Spring users may prefer to implement the <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/migration/spring/SpringJdbcMigration.html"
            >SpringJdbcMigration</a></strong> interface to gain access to a Spring JdbcTemplate instead of a plain JDBC connection.</p>

    <p>For even more flexibility with regard to naming and checksums you can additionally implement the <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/migration/MigrationInfoProvider.html"
            >MigrationInfoProvider</a></strong> and <strong><a
            href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/migration/MigrationChecksumProvider.html"
            >MigrationChecksumProvider</a></strong> interfaces.</p>

    <h2>Java-based Callbacks</h2>

    <p>Building upon that are the <a href="/documentation/callbacks.html">Java-based Callbacks</a>
        when you need more power or flexibility in a Callback than SQL can offer you.</p>

    <p>This can be achieved by implementing the <strong><a href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/callback/FlywayCallback.html">FlywayCallback</a></strong>
        interface.</p>

    <h2>Custom Migration resolvers &amp; executors</h2>

    <p>For those that need more than what the SQL and Java-based migrations offer, you also have the possibility to
    implement your own <strong><a href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/resolver/MigrationResolver.html">MigrationResolver</a></strong>
        coupled with a custom <strong><a href="/documentation/api/javadoc/org/flywaydb/core/api/resolver/MigrationExecutor.html">MigrationExecutor</a></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>These can then be used for loading things like CSV-based migrations or other custom formats.</p>
