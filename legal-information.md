### Visiting our websites

When you visit one of our websites, we collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behavior patterns, including through the use of third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics). We do this to understand how people are using our websites, to manage their operation and to diagnose any problems. We retain these logs for up to three months.

We use Marketo to track your engagement with our website, and help give you the most relevant information on our products and solutions. This data is visible to our sales and marketing teams. We keep data you have provided to us, for example if you fill out a form on our website, for the duration of our commercial relationship with you.

We also use third-party services to help us identify visitors to our website to improve the way we offer our products and services.

We rely on the lawful basis of legitimate interests to process this data.

Our website search is powered by Google. Search queries and results are logged anonymously to help us improve our website and search functionality. No user-specific data is collected by either Redgate or any third party.

### How we use cookies

Your web browser allows you to control whether cookies can be stored by our websites. However, disabling cookies will prevent certain parts of our websites from working correctly. Your web browser’s documentation has more information on controlling cookie behavior.

We use cookies on our websites to:

- Track the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns
- Analyze the way people use our websites
- Gather data on how our websites are performing

### Newsletters

We send newsletters using MailChimp and HubSpot. We gather statistics around email opening and interaction using industry-standard technologies, including tracking pixels, to analyze the performance of email campaigns. 

We use data about your interactions with our emails as an indicator of your interest in our products. We may also use your interaction with our previous newsletters to send you more appropriate information in the future.

You can opt out of receiving these newsletters at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in these emails.

### Contacting us via social media

Boxfuse maintains a presence on Twitter. If you send us a message via social media, we may include this in our Redgate group CRM systems.

### Purchasing our products

If you purchase our products, we collect contact details (name, email address and telephone number) for the purchaser and, if you choose, separate technical and billing email addresses. We use these to generate your license and, if applicable, support. 

We also ask for information about the environment you will be using Flyway in (for example, the database engines and versions you use, and any continuous integration servers you use) to help us prioritize product development.

If you purchase online, your payment will be handled by FastSpring. For more information, see [their privacy statement](https://fastspring.com/privacy/).

### Connecting with our product support teams

If you engage with our support teams, we may ask you to provide additional information to help us assist you (like diagnostic logs). We may share this internally with our teams to support you and to enable them to reproduce and fix product issues. We may also cross reference your interactions with us in order to understand the customer journey, improve our self-help articles and to give you the best support experience.

### Call recording

We record some calls for training and quality purposes to help us evaluate our performance and better understand the needs of our customers. If you live in the USA and two-party consent is required, we’ll let you know we’re recording the call at the start.

### Information sent to us when you use our products

Our products send usage and fault reporting information to us. We use this to:

- Measure the success of our sales and marketing operations
- Guide product development decisions and improve our products
- Assist you in your evaluation, purchasing, and renewal of our products
- Compare your usage of our products against the licenses you've purchased

We use your basic environment and high-level usage data in conjunction with your records in our Redgate group marketing and CRM systems. Your use of individual features is submitted anonymously and is not linked to your identity.

Some of our products allow you to submit error reports if something goes wrong. These contain logs and other diagnostic data, and you can choose to include your contact details and any additional information you think may be useful. Our support and development teams use this data to improve our products.

If you choose not to include diagnostic data with an error report, an anonymous record of the type of error which occurred will be sent. This allows us to measure how many of our customers experience errors and prioritise our focus for product development.

### Sharing your information with third parties

Redgate uses select organizations to help us process data which helps us deliver our products and services to you. We will not sell any data regarding your use of our products or services except as part of a reorganization or a sale of the assets of Redgate, and we will ensure that your privacy continues to be protected.

If you're a customer, potential customer, or you otherwise have a commercial relationship with Redgate, you can find the current list of organizations [here](https://www.red-gate.com/website/third-parties).
